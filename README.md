## What it does
This plugin loads the [MathJAX](https://www.mathjax.org/) library, allowing MathJAX compatible code (LaTEX, MathML and ASCIImath) to be displayed in an article.

## How to use it
Add MathJAX compatible code to an article, eg:

```
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
```
The code will then be rendered when the article is viewed in the front page.
